QUESTION 160

You are creating a class by using C#. The class will manage writing log entries to a file.

You have the following code. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)


<img src="img/160-01.jpg">													

c19 if (disposing)
c20 {
c21 log.Flush();
c22 log.Dispose();
c23 }
c24
c25 }
c26 public void Dispose()
c27 {
c28 Dispose(true);
c29 GC.SupressFinalize(this);
c30 }
c31 }

You test the class by using the following code.

<img src="img/160-02.jpg">

When you run the text, you receive the following error message: "System.ObjectDisposedException: ‘Cannot write to a closed TextWritter." 

You need to ensure that LogWriter closes the log file properly without raising an exception.

Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. Add `bool disposed=false;` at line c06.

B. Change line c19 to `if(disposed)`.

C. Add `if (disposed) return;` at line c18.

D. Remove line t05.

E. Add `disposed=true;` at line c24.

F. Remove line c21.

<u>Correct Answer</u>: **ACE**
