QUESTION 033

You are developing an assembly that will be used by multiple applications.

You need to install the assembly in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Which two actions can you perform to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. Use the Assembly Registration tool (regasm.exe) to register the assembly and to copy the assembly to the GAC.

B. Use the Strong Name tool (sn.exe) to copy the assembly into the GAC.

C. Use Microsoft Register Server (regsvr32.exe) to add the assembly to the GAC.

D. Use the Global Assembly Cache tool (gacutil.exe) to add the assembly to the GAC.

E. Use Windows Installer 2.0 to add the assembly to the GAC.

<u>Correct Answer:</u> **DE**

There are two ways to deploy an assembly into the global assembly cache:

Use an installer designed to work with the global assembly cache. This is the preferred option for installing assemblies into the global assembly cache.

Use a developer tool called the Global Assembly Cache tool (Gacutil.exe), provided by the Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK).

Note:

In deployment scenarios, use Windows Installer 2.0 to install assemblies into the global assembly cache. 

Use the Global Assembly Cache tool only in development scenarios, because it does not provide assembly reference counting and other features provided when using the Windows Installer.
